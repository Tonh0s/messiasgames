These terms and conditions apply to the MessiasGames applications (hereby referred to as the "Application") for mobile devices that were created by MessiasGames (hereby referred to as the "Service Provider") as a Free service.

Upon downloading or using the Application, you automatically agree to these Terms and Conditions. It is strongly recommended that you read and fully understand these terms before using the Application. Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or the Service Provider’s trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to extract the source code of the Application, translate it into other languages, or create derivative versions is not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the exclusive property of the Service Provider.

The Service Provider is committed to ensuring that the Application is as useful and efficient as possible. For this reason, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for its services at any time and for any reason. Any charges related to the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to users in advance.

The Application stores and processes personal data provided by you in order to deliver the Service. It is your responsibility to keep your device secure and maintain safe access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your device, as this removes operating system security restrictions and may expose your device to malware, viruses, or other security vulnerabilities. Such actions may also cause the Application to malfunction or stop working entirely.

Please note that the Application uses third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. These may include:

Google Play Services

AdMob

Unity Technologies

The Service Provider assumes no responsibility for certain aspects of the Application. Some features require an active internet connection, either via Wi-Fi or a mobile data network. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function fully due to lack of internet access or if you have exceeded your data allowance.

If you use the Application outside a Wi-Fi area, your mobile network provider’s terms will still apply. You may incur data usage charges, including roaming charges if you use the Application outside your home region without disabling data roaming. By using the Application, you accept responsibility for any such charges. If you are not the bill payer for the device, it is assumed that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.

The Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for how you use the Application. For example, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you cannot access the Service, the Service Provider is not responsible.

While the Service Provider strives to ensure that the Application is updated and accurate, they rely on third-party sources for certain information. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any direct or indirect loss resulting from reliance on information provided by the Application.

The Service Provider may update the Application from time to time. Operating system requirements may change, and you may need to download updates to continue using the Application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that the Application will always be updated to remain compatible with all operating system versions. However, you agree to accept updates when offered. The Service Provider may also discontinue the Application at any time without prior notice. Upon termination:
(a) the rights and licenses granted to you under these terms will end;
(b) you must stop using the Application and, if necessary, delete it from your device.

Changes to These Terms and Conditions

The Service Provider may update these Terms and Conditions periodically. Users are advised to review this page regularly. Changes will be effective once the updated Terms and Conditions are published.

These terms and conditions are effective as of 2026-01-18.
